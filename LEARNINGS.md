# Project Learnings — HealthAppTransfer

> This file accumulates knowledge over time. Claude reads it each session to avoid repeating mistakes and leverage successful patterns.

## Patterns That Work

<!-- Approaches that have proven successful in this project -->

### Code Patterns
<!-- Successful coding patterns discovered -->
_None documented yet. Use `/learn` to add patterns._

### Testing Patterns
<!-- What works for testing in this project -->
_None documented yet._

### Architecture Patterns
<!-- Structural decisions that work well -->
_None documented yet._

## Mistakes to Avoid

<!-- Things that didn't work - don't repeat these -->

### Failed Approaches
<!-- Approaches that were tried and failed -->
_None documented yet. Use `/learn` to record failures._

### Common Pitfalls
<!-- Gotchas specific to this project -->
- xcodegen overwrites `.entitlements` files to empty `<dict/>` during `generate` — always restore entitlements content after running xcodegen.

### Anti-Patterns Found
<!-- Patterns that cause problems here -->
_None documented yet._

## Codebase Knowledge

<!-- Deep understanding of this specific codebase -->

### Key Abstractions
<!-- Important concepts/classes/modules and how they work -->
_None documented yet._

### Integration Points
<!-- How different parts connect -->
_None documented yet._

### Performance Considerations
<!-- What affects performance in this codebase -->
_None documented yet._

## External Dependencies

<!-- Knowledge about libraries, APIs, services used -->

### Library Quirks
<!-- Unexpected behaviors in dependencies -->
_None documented yet._

### API Patterns
<!-- How to effectively use external APIs -->
_None documented yet._

## Process Learnings

<!-- What works for development workflow -->

### Effective Workflows
<!-- Sequences of actions that work well -->
_None documented yet._

### Communication Patterns
<!-- How to effectively work with the user -->
_None documented yet._

## Session Insights

<!-- Learnings from specific sessions -->

## How to Add Learnings

Use the `/learn` command to add new learnings:
- `/learn pattern: [description]` - Record a successful pattern
- `/learn mistake: [description]` - Record something to avoid
- `/learn insight: [description]` - Record codebase knowledge

Or ask Claude: "Record that [X] works well" or "Remember to avoid [Y]"
